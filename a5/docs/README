1) All used Jars will be packaged into the runnable jar for each application.  Here is a list of used libraries.

	PizzaMobileApp:
	android-support-v4.jar
	android-support-v7-appcompat.jar

	PizzaInStore:
	commons-logging-1.2.jar
	httpclient-4.3.6.jar
	httpcore-4.3.3.jar

	PizzaBackend:


2) The most important detail about running our project is that the server must be run on saint-paul in the cs120 lab.
The android application has the port number and server address hard coded to be saint-paul:8000.  We apologize for the inconvenience.
	
	To run the pizza mobile App. for Android  start an android virtual device and run the command:
	adb install PizzaMobileApp.apk.	

	To run the in store pizza client application use:
	java -jar PizzaInStore.jar

	To run the PizzaBackend server application SSH to saint-paul.cs.colostate.edu and use:
	java -jar PizzaBackend.jar

3)

	Employee login information (for instore application):

		logins: 001 - 003
		passwords: password

	User Logins (for mobile app):
		
		Usernames: bm2, bm3, or bm4
		passwords: pass

4)  A strength is remote invocation.  We think it works really well, and is a neat way to write a client server application.  A weakenss is certainly the UI look and feel; it is not very pretty. 

5)  We think we are closest to a Model-View-controller pattern.  Perhaps some of our controllers are a bit bloated.
